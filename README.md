# SORTING ALGORITHMS & BIG O NOTATION

In this project, I learned about sorting algorithms. A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.

Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:

    1. The output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).
    2. The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.

Sorting algorithms can be classified by:
	1. Time complexity
	2. Memory usage
	3. Stability
	4. Insertion or External sort
	5. and many more...

Specifically, I worked with bubble, insertion , selection and quicksort algorithms.

I also learned about Big O Notation i.e. *a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm*. How to evaluate time complexity of an algorithm and how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
